      <h1>Lionel Messi</h1>
      <h2>Widely regarded as one of the greatest players of all time</h2>
      <p>
        Born and raised in central Argentina, Messi relocated to Spain at the
        age of 13 to join Barcelona, for whom he made his competitive debut aged
        17 in October 2004. He established himself as an integral player for the
        club within the next three years, and in his first uninterrupted season
        in 2008–09 he helped Barcelona achieve the first treble in Spanish
        football; that year, aged 22, Messi won his first Ballon d'Or. Three
        successful seasons followed, with Messi winning four consecutive Ballons
        d'Or, making him the first player to win the award four times. During
        the 2011–12 season, he set the La Liga and European records for most
        goals scored in a single season, while establishing himself as
        Barcelona's all-time top scorer. The following two seasons, Messi
        finished second for the Ballon d'Or behind Cristiano Ronaldo (his
        perceived career rival), before regaining his best form during the
        2014–15 campaign, becoming the all-time top scorer in La Liga and
        leading Barcelona to a historic second treble, after which he was
        awarded a fifth Ballon d'Or in 2015. Messi assumed captaincy of
        Barcelona in 2018, and in 2019 he won a record sixth Ballon d'Or. Out of
        contract, he signed for Paris Saint-Germain in August 2021.
